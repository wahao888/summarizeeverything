side we have validators and there's about a hundred and ten twenty billion dollars worth of validators on the far left side we have users or traders and when these traders uh submit their trades it typically goes into one of these block builders or into like this public mempool so you might be familiar with some of these guys i don't know titan builder beaver uh this is basically uh jared from subway if anyone knows that so jared from subway this is winter mute uh flash botch which uh some of you guys might know as well but basically these guys assemble blocks and traditionally the validator just takes the highest block and this entire process takes 12 seconds what we're doing is we basically negotiated with a whole bunch of validators to sell the block space in advance so the validator is basically giving the block to us and we're going to confirm transactions on behalf of the validator and that allows us to confirm transactions in three milliseconds because again these validators are not that tech savvy they don't move that fast it takes them 12 seconds to go through this process but if they just sell the block to us or give the block to us in advance and we act on their behalf again we can confirm everything in three milliseconds and that allows us to supplement or basically make the train much faster so you can basically buy transactions we're creating like basically a futures market for gas so you can buy part of the next block or you can buy part of the next 10 20 64 blocks so up here this is the price if you want to buy the entire block of ethereum and you can do that for the next 12 or 13 minutes you could basically buy the block you know put your own transactions in it kind of do whatever you'd like or you could build the block like the block builders or if you just want to buy like a little piece of the block this is kind of the price down here as i mentioned there's about 110 billion dollars of validators on ethereum today we have give or take about uh you know two-thirds to three-quarters of them on board to basically sell this block space in advance and what this means is that uh when we go to mainnet shortly maybe not immediately but shortly thereafter about two-thirds of every block on ethereum will be able to be traded within a three millisecond basis so um you basically hit that connect or hit that trade sorry hit that trade on your metamask and you're getting very fast instant confirmations but i guess the question is where does this lead and so as i mentioned we're doing gas futures so you can just you can buy block space in the physical market you can also trade it as an instrument gas of course is incredibly volatile it is the most volatile instrument and you can trade gas as an instrument but as you can kind of trade it into the futures market we're basically creating like this futures curve which could extend you know a one day or even a year to basically hedge your gas exposure and this is critically important for traders or mev players or protocols and uh pre-comps or pre-confirmations by definition as i said they provide this certainty on the trading side you get certainty that your trades will be included in the block but on the validator side you get this like fixed income stream or the certainty and fixed income here is really the key because if you can get a fixed income stream come on there we go uh if you get a fixed income stream that you basically get fixed rate staking and so for the first time we'll be able to create fixed rate staking which will radically change the landscape of crypto because as a whole what everyone in crypto is hoping for and what i'm hoping for is this button's going to work what everyone is hoping for in crypto is that we challenge traditional finance but the thing is that in in the map of the broader financial ecosystem we got to figure out interest rates we got to figure out fixed rate interest rates and fixed rate rates unlock the entire ecosystem of crypto for to enable it to compete with the traditional financial markets and that's what pre-confirmations enable all right there we go so three milliseconds for everyone on ethereum if you're a validator across those 100 billion dollars of validators you'll be able to earn somewhere between half and one percent more for every single one of them that's uh that's us we're going to mainnet early next year thank you for having me so airdrop okay event at mr black just 是拿 Sweetare 生態的治理代幣作為抵押品來生產 Buck 的穩定幣 
而且他們也即將的要發行代幣 叫做 B.U.T 所以我們現在有請的人 Damian
